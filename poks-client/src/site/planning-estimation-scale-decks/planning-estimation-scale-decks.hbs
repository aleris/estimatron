            <h2>Planning Poker Estimation Decks</h2>
            <p>
                Members of the team make features estimates by playing numbered cards face-down to the table.
                The value on the card usually represent the number of story points but ideal days can also be used as
                estimation units.
                There are several deck types that are often used in planning poker:
            </p>
            <h3 id="fibonacci">Fibonacci</h3>
            <p>
                Probably the most used deck has cards showing the Fibonacci sequence:
            </p>
            <pre>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89</pre>
            <p>
                The reason the fibonacci sequence works very well for software estimation is that it naturally reflects
                the uncertainty of the estimation for higher values.
                Also it prevents the estimates to be too close to one another for higher values and allows for better
                team consensus even for rough estimates.
            </p>
            <p>
                One disadvantage is that for higher values, a number like 21 might be interpreted like a very precise
                measurement (versus just saying 20 for example).
            </p>
            <p>
                The sequence might also include additional values like 0, âˆž, â˜• or ? as
                <a href="#additional-values">described below</a>.
            </p>

            <h3 id="modified-fibonacci">Modified Fibonacci</h3>
            <p>
                Several commercially available planning poker decks use the sequence:
            </p>
            <pre>0, Â½, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100</pre>
            <p>
                The reason for not exactly following the Fibonacci sequence after 13 is the for higher values the
                uncertainty increases and using a very precise number (21) might be interpreted as a very precise
                estimation.
                Using numbers with only a single digit of precision for higher values indicates the uncertainty in the
                estimation.
            </p>

            <h3 id="power-of-two">Power of Two</h3>
            <p>The exponential growing sequence of power of two increases more rapidly:</p>

            <pre>1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128</pre>

            <p>
                This sequence can be used when the tasks are bigger and cover a higher range of effort.
            </p>

            <h3 id="sequential">Sequential</h3>
            <p>The sequential values cover a smaller range of effort:</p>

            <pre>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10</pre>

            <p>
                This sequence can be used when the tasks are small, require a higher estimate precision and the range of
                effort to cover is relatively small.
            </p>

            <h3 id="t-shirts">T-Shirts</h3>
            <p>T-Shirt sizes are also sometimes used:</p>

            <pre>XS, S, M, L, XL</pre>

            <p>
                This sequence can be used when the tasks very small and the range of effort to cover is very small.
            </p>

            <h3 id="additional-values">Additional Values</h3>
            <p>
                When using planning poker cards for estimation, there are several values that are usually included on
                cards:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>?</strong> - <em>"unsure"</em> - means that the team member does not know to estimate the
                    story with sufficient confidence, usually because it is in a zone it does not know or there are
                    necessary details that are missing
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>0</strong> - <em>"zero"</em> - means that the work is already done or it might not be
                    necessary to do because is already included in other story/stories.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>âˆž</strong> - <em>"infinite"</em> - means that the story can never be completed for reasons
                    that will be explained in the revealing phase or is so huge that it doesn't even make sense to
                    estimate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>â˜•</strong> - <em>"coffee"</em> - means a coffee break request, when the planning session is
                    running long is a way for players to request a break. Traditionally the one that is making the
                    request is also bringing coffee to all team members. For obvious reasons this will not work in a
                    remote setup ðŸ˜€.
                </li>
            </ul>
